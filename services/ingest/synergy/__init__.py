"""Synergy pattern registry for the MTG ingest pipeline.

Sub-modules, each covering one broad theme:

* :mod:`events`           — core event triggers (ETB, dies, attacks, cast, phase,
                            landfall, discard, token, counter, combat_damage,
                            sacrifice) and their producer SQL fragments.
* :mod:`lifegain`         — four lifegain consumer patterns (``lifegain``,
                            ``lifegain_threshold``, ``lifegain_replacement``,
                            ``lifegain_total``) and their producer SQL fragments.
* :mod:`deckbuilding`     — cross-archetype deckbuilding themes (equipment,
                            legendary, graveyard, +1/+1 counters, artifacts,
                            modified, aura, proliferate, skullclamp,
                            play_from_exile).
* :mod:`tribal`           — dynamically generated tribal patterns for all tribes
                            in :data:`TRIBES`, including Zombie/Angel cross-synergy
                            overrides.
* :mod:`utility`          — utility-role patterns present in most Commander decks:
                            draw engines (``spell_draw``, ``creature_draw``,
                            ``wheel``), removal (``targeted_removal``, ``burn``,
                            ``wither``, ``bounce``, ``sweeper``), tutors
                            (``tutor_creature``, ``tutor_artifact``, ``tutor_any``),
                            interaction (``counterspell_hard``,
                            ``counterspell_conditional``, ``counterspell_redirect``,
                            ``protection``), and combat tricks (``evasion_grant``,
                            ``combat_tricks``).
* :mod:`commander_value`  — "free-if-commander" and persistent-bonus cards that
                            reward having a commander in play (Deflecting Swat,
                            Fierce Guardianship, Loyal Apprentice, Jeska's Will,
                            Mox Amber, …).  Producers are low-MV (CMC ≤ 2)
                            legendary creatures/planeswalkers.  These edges use
                            ``score_type = 'commander_value'`` and are built by
                            the dedicated ``compute_commander_value_synergy()``
                            stage in ``pipeline.py``.
* :mod:`roles`            — functional deck-role patterns (``ramp``, ``draw_one``,
                            ``repeatable_draw``, ``removal``, ``sweeper``, ``tutor``,
                            ``protection``, ``win_condition``, ``anthem``,
                            ``token_generator``, ``recursion``, ``interaction``,
                            ``combat_trick``, ``mana_land``, ``utility_land``).
                            Stored as ``ability_type = 'role'`` rows in
                            ``card_abilities``.

``pipeline.py`` imports :data:`TRIGGER_PATTERNS`, :data:`PRODUCER_MAP`,
:data:`TRIBES`, :data:`ROLE_PATTERNS`, :data:`LAND_ROLE_PATTERNS`, and
:data:`COMMANDER_VALUE_EDGE_SCORES` from this package — no other changes to
the pipeline are needed when a sub-module is extended.
